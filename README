Joint Genotyping

BUILDING

Follow the instructions in each folder

RUNNING

1) Run shards_picker to pick the tentative shard boundaries given your chosen
   number of shards. 
   I suggest picking the shards such that each shard has total size on the order
   of the amount of memory available in your machines.

2) Run mindexer on each input's index. This can be done in parallel.

3) Run Sharder and GATK GenotypeGVCF for each shard. This can be done in parallel.

4) Concatenate the GenotypeGVCF outputs. The resulting file is your final
   output.
