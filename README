Joint Genotyping

BUILDING

Follow the instructions in each folder

RUNNING

1) Run shards_picker to pick the tentative shard boundaries given your chosen
   number of shards. 
   I suggest picking the shards such that each shard has total size on the order
   of the amount of memory available in your machines.

The resulting output is the "shards file". Keep it locally, it's an input to
the Sharder.

2) Run mindexer on each input's index. This can be done in parallel.

The resulting outputs are the "mindexes". Keep them on Google Cloud Storage.
Write a file that lists the mindexes in order. This is the "mindex file", it's
an input to the Sharder.

3) Run Sharder and GATK GenotypeGVCF for each shard. This can be done in parallel.

4) Concatenate the GenotypeGVCF outputs. The resulting file is your final
   output.
